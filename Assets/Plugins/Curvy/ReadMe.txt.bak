VERSION HISTORY
===============

Note: Starting from version 3.0.0, Curvy is using the versioning standard “Semantic Versioning 2.0.0”. More about it here : https://semver.org/

7.1.4
	Curvy Generator
		[CHANGE] Spline Input modules: Now when the StartCP or EndCP is automatically set to null because its value is invalid, an error message is displayed in the console to notify the user about the value override and the reason behind it
		[OPTIM] TRS modules and the Relative Translation module: less CPU consumption
		[FIXED] Shape Extrusion and Path Rasterization modules: When the Range paramter loops, and if using the Optimized option, the Advanced Scaling does not work on the path's part that is beyong the looping point
		[FIXED] TRS modules: Using a TRS module on a closed path makes the extruded mesh using it not align at its looping point
	Shapes
		[FIXED] Sometimes, after selecting a spline, the Shape creation and edition buttons need to be clicked twice to work 
		[FIXED] The Shape Wizard's background is not drawn properly when the Curvy toolbar is placed at the bottom side or right side of the screen
		[FIXED] Creating a Shape through the Shape Wizard when having another shape selected leads to creating an empty shape
		[API/CHANGE] Made CurvyShape.Persistent obsolete
	Others
		[NEW] Added the Asteroid Belt Youtube tutorial scene as example scene 28
		[CHANGE] Replaced example scene 24 with the Conform To Terrain Youtube tutorial scene
		[CHANGE] Added a background to the Shift tool's UI for more visibility
		[CHANGE] Replace a Connection Synchronization icon for the dark theme UI for more visibility
		[CHANGE] Minor improvements in UI and documentation
		[FIXED] A compiler warning appears when using Unity 2020.2 or above
			Sorry about this one, the fix was accidentally not included in 7.1.3.

7.1.3
	[FIXED] Compiler warnings appear when using Unity 2020.2 or above

7.1.2
	[FIXED] Curvy Generator: module's background does not have the right size on Unity 2019.3 and newer
	
7.1.1
	[FIXED] Compiler error when using Unity 2019.1
	
7.1.0
	Unity editor's Undo
		[CHANGE] Made the Make Planar operation undoable
		[CHANGE] Made the Connection inspector's operations undoable
		[FIXED] Undoing Bézier handles modification does not reflect on connected control points when Bézier handles are set to be synchronized
		[FIXED] Undoing the creation of control points via the "Add & Smart Connect" tool (CTRL + right click when creating splines) sometimes is not done properly or even leads to errors
		[FIXED] Undoing the removal of a connected control point does not restore the connection
		[FIXED] Undoing the removal of a connected control point stops its spline from refreshing when said control point is moved
		[FIXED] When undoing shape modifications done via the shape wizard, the shape can become weird looking
		[FIXED] Deleting a Control Point, if undone, will restore the CP at the wrong position in the spline's hierarchy
		[API/NEW] Added CurvySpline.Delete(CurvySplineSegment controlPoint, bool skipRefreshingAndEvents, bool isUndoableDelete)
	Connections
		[CHANGE] "Add and smart connect" tool: Now all the added CPs have their heading set to automatic
		[FIXED] "Add and smart connect" tool: Adding a CP to an existing connection, having some CPs synchronized and others not, can lead to all the connection's CPs to synchronize their transform

		[FIXED] Follow-Up: Automatic heading direction is sometimes not resolved properly.
			The "Automatic" heading direction will now be resolved to "To spline's end" instead of "Nowhere" when no obvious value is found. It gives better result most of the time
		[FIXED] Duplicating a connected spline will create a spline that seems connected while it isn't
		[API/NEW] Added CurvyConnection.Disconnect(bool destroyEmptyConnection)
		[API/NEW] Added CurvySplineSegment's CanFollowUpHeadToEnd and CanFollowUpHeadToStart
		[API/CHANGE] Made CurvyConnection.ResetConnectionRelatedData obsolete

		[NEW] The following metrics are now send to Curvy's server at each import of a new Curvy version: Curvy version, Unity version, Scripting version.
			The collected metrics will help making decisions when it comes to maintaining Curvy's old code, and using Unity's version specific features. The send data is anonymous
		[CHANGE] Made the "Generate Assembly Definition" button's icon compatible with the dark ("Professional") editor theme
		[FIXED] Wrong UV2 calculation when UV scale is in between 0 and 1

		[API/FIXED] CurvySpline.ToLocalDirection does not return the expected result
		[API/FIXED] CurvySpline.IsControlPointASegment returns true for all PCs of a closed spline, even if said spline has only one CP
			This bug lead to erroneous values for the following properties: FirstVisibleControlPoint, FirstSegment, LastVisibleControlPoint and LastSegment
		[API/FIXED] CurvySpline's GetNextControlPointIndex and GetPreviousControlPointIndex returning 0 instead of -1 when called on a CP that is the only CP of a closed spline

			[FIXED] Setting the Space Before, Space After, or Position Offset as random values will modify the randomly generated rotations and height
			[FIXED] A group's Space Before and Space After are considered even if the group is not placed because of Keep Together
			[FIXED] When a repeating group with Keep Together set to true is not placed because of a lack of space, the following group is positioned as if the first group was placed
			[FIXED] When a group has Keep Together set to false, and there is no room to fit all group's items, the placed items are out of order
			[FIXED] When a group, that is not part of the repeatable groups, has items that are not randomly selected, those items are placed at the wrong position
